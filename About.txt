ABSTRACT
The increasing number of road accidents involving motorcyclists has highlighted the need for enhanced safety measures. This project presents the design and implementation of a Smart Helmet integrated with an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) to ensure rider safety through real-time monitoring and preventive actions. The system employs various sensors and modules including an IR sensor for helmet detection, an eye blink sensor for drowsiness detection, an alcohol sensor to prevent drunk driving, a MEMS sensor for accident detection, and GPS and GSM modules for real-time location tracking and emergency communication. The helmet is designed to prevent the vehicle from starting unless it is securely worn. It also monitors the rider's physiological state, detecting signs of drowsiness or alcohol consumption. In the event of an accident, the system automatically sends an SOS message with the rider's GPS location to emergency contacts. Additionally, an emergency button allows the rider to manually trigger an alert if needed. This system leverages IoT technology to enable remote monitoring and data logging, offering a comprehensive solution that enhances the safety and security of motorcyclists. The Smart Helmet's ability to proactively address potential risks before they result in accidents, coupled with its real-time emergency response features, positions it as a critical tool in reducing fatalities and injuries on the road..



EXISTING SYSTEM
The existing systems designed for motorcyclist safety typically focus on either passive safety features or basic monitoring without significant automation or advanced response mechanisms. Some of the common technologies and limitations in current use include:
1.	Standard Helmets:
o	Traditional helmets primarily provide passive protection by reducing the risk of head injury in case of an accident. While they are essential for rider safety, they lack any built-in electronic or communication features to prevent accidents or alert authorities in emergencies.
2.	Basic Alcohol Detection Systems:
o	Some motorcycles are equipped with basic breathalyzers that prevent the vehicle from starting if alcohol is detected. However, these systems are often standalone and lack integration with other safety features, such as emergency communication or location tracking.
3.	Vehicle Immobilizers:
o	Immobilizer systems are used to prevent theft or unauthorized use of motorcycles. These systems may also be integrated with helmet detection sensors, where the bike will not start unless the rider is wearing a helmet. However, these systems generally do not monitor the rider’s condition or provide any post-accident response.
4.	Manual Emergency Systems:
o	Some advanced helmets or bike accessories may include an emergency button that the rider can press to send a distress signal in case of an accident. These systems typically require manual activation, which may not be possible if the rider is unconscious or incapacitated.
5.	Bluetooth-Enabled Helmets:
o	Helmets equipped with Bluetooth technology allow riders to connect to their smartphones for hands-free communication and navigation. While this adds convenience, it does not significantly contribute to rider safety in terms of accident prevention or automated emergency response.
6.	Telematics and GPS Tracking:
o	GPS tracking devices are available for motorcycles, primarily for theft prevention and recovery. These devices can track the location of the vehicle but do not typically monitor the rider's condition or provide emergency alerts unless manually activated.
Limitations of Existing Systems
•	Lack of Integration: Most existing systems are standalone and do not provide a comprehensive solution that integrates multiple safety features like accident detection, alcohol monitoring, and real-time communication.
•	Reactive Rather Than Proactive: Current technologies focus more on post-accident responses rather than preventing accidents from occurring in the first place.
•	Manual Operation: Many existing emergency systems require manual activation, which may not be feasible in critical situations where the rider is incapacitated.
•	Limited Monitoring: Systems that monitor the rider’s condition, such as alcohol detection, often lack real-time data transmission and automated alerts, limiting their effectiveness in preventing accidents or ensuring a quick response.


EXISTING SYSTEM DISADVANTAGES
•	Lack of real-time hazard detection: Existing helmets typically do not incorporate sensors like ultrasonic sensors, eye blinking sensors, and color sensors, limiting their ability to detect and respond to immediate hazards on the road.
•	 Limited driver condition monitoring: Traditional helmets do not monitor the wearer's fatigue level or intoxication, increasing the risk of accidents due to impaired driving.
•	 Absence of navigation assistance: Standard helmets lack GPS functionality, making it challenging for users to navigate unfamiliar routes or receive real-time directions.
•	 Inability to provide remote monitoring: Without IoT connectivity, existing helmets cannot transmit vital data or emergency alerts to a centralized system, reducing their effectiveness in critical situations.
•	 Minimal integration of advanced technologies: Current helmet designs often overlook the potential benefits of integrating advanced technologies, such as automated hazard detection and adaptive lighting, which are crucial for modern road safety standards.

PROPOSED SYSTEM
The proposed system aims to enhance motorcyclist safety by integrating multiple advanced technologies into a single smart helmet, providing both proactive and reactive safety measures. This system not only prevents accidents but also ensures immediate response in case of emergencies, thereby addressing the limitations of existing solutions.
Key Features of the Proposed System:
1.	Helmet Detection with IR Sensor:
o	The system incorporates an IR sensor to detect whether the helmet is worn by the rider. The motorcycle will not start unless the helmet is properly in place, ensuring that the rider always wears the helmet before operating the vehicle.
2.	Drowsiness Detection with Eye Blink Sensor:
o	The helmet is equipped with an eye blink sensor to monitor the rider’s eye movements. If the sensor detects patterns consistent with drowsiness, the system issues a warning to the rider and can automatically take corrective actions, such as slowing down the vehicle.
3.	Alcohol Detection System:
o	An alcohol sensor measures the rider's breath alcohol concentration. If the alcohol level exceeds a predefined threshold, the system disables the motorcycle's ignition, preventing the rider from operating the vehicle under the influence. Additionally, it sends an alert with the rider's GPS location to emergency contacts via the GSM module.
4.	Accident Detection using MEMS Sensor:
o	The system includes a MEMS sensor to detect sudden impacts or abnormal movements that may indicate an accident. Upon detecting a potential crash, the system automatically sends an SOS message, including the GPS coordinates, to emergency services or pre-set contacts, ensuring quick assistance.
5.	Emergency Button:
o	The helmet features an emergency button that the rider can press to manually send a distress signal. This feature allows the rider to alert others in case of any emergency, with the message containing real-time location data.
6.	Real-Time Location Tracking with GPS and GSM Modules:
o	The GPS module continuously tracks the rider’s location, and the GSM module allows for real-time communication. In the event of an accident or emergency, the system sends the location details to emergency contacts, enabling a swift response.
7.	IoT Integration for Remote Monitoring:
o	The smart helmet is connected to an IoT platform, allowing for real-time monitoring and data logging. This feature enables remote access to the helmet's status, including the rider’s condition and location. In case of any abnormalities, alerts are sent to a connected smartphone or monitoring system.
8.	Relay-Controlled Ignition System:
o	A relay is used to control the motorcycle's ignition based on the inputs from the helmet’s sensors. The relay ensures that the vehicle can only be operated when all safety conditions are met, such as helmet presence and alcohol-free breath.
Advantages of the Proposed System:
•	Comprehensive Safety: The integration of various sensors and modules provides a holistic approach to rider safety, addressing both accident prevention and emergency response.
•	Automated Responses: The system is designed to take automatic actions, such as disabling the ignition or sending SOS alerts, without requiring manual intervention, ensuring effectiveness even if the rider is incapacitated.
•	Proactive Monitoring: The use of eye blink sensors and alcohol detection provides proactive measures to prevent accidents caused by drowsiness or intoxication.
•	Real-Time Connectivity: IoT integration and real-time communication ensure that the rider’s status and location are continuously monitored, allowing for immediate intervention in case of emergencies.
•	User-Friendly Operation: The system’s automation reduces the need for user interaction, making it easy and intuitive for riders to use while providing maximum safety benefits.
This proposed system represents a significant advancement in motorcyclist safety technology, offering a robust solution that not only protects riders but also ensures rapid assistance in critical situations.

MODULE DESCRIPTION:

SENSOR INTERFACING
•	Sensor interfacing is a mix of amplification, filtering, and other signal conditioning as well as analog-to-digital conversion. The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) may be in your microcontroller, but you will still need to make the sensor compatible with the ADC input.
PREPARING POWER SUPPLY UNIT
•	A power supply unit (or PSU) converts mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a controller.  A power supply is used to reduce the mains electricity at 240 volts AC down to something more useable, say 12 volts DC. There are two types of power supply, linear and switch mode. A linear power supply uses a transformer to reduce the voltage. The AC signal is rectified and regulated to produce a high DC voltage.
•	An AC adapter, AC/DC adapter, or AC/DC converteris a type of external power supply, often enclosed in a case similar to an AC plug. Adapters for battery-powered equipment may be described as chargers or rechargers (see also battery charger). AC adapters are used with electrical devices that require power but do not contain internal components to derive the required voltage and power from main power. The internal circuitry of an external power supply is very similar to the design that would be used for a built-in or internal supply.

MICRO-CONTROLLER PROGRAMMING
•	A microcontroller is a programmable IC, capable of multiple functions depending on how it’s programed. Many different kinds of microcontrollers exist that offer a wide range of functionality. The versatility of the microcontroller is what makes it one of the most powerful tools in modern design. This guide will explain the basics of microcontrollers and how they are programmed.
READING ANALOG DATA
•	The microcontroller of the board has a circuit inside called an analog-to-digital converter or ADC that reads this changing voltage and converts it to a number between 0 and 1023. When the shaft is turned all the way in one direction, there are 0 volts going to the pin, and the input value is 0. When the shaft is turned all the way in the opposite direction, there are 5 volts going to the pin and the input value is 1023. In between, analog Read() returns a number between 0 and 1023 that is proportional to the amount of voltage being applied to the pin.
TEST AND DEBUG
•	Testing means verifying correct behavior. Testing can be done at all stages of module development: requirements analysis, interface design, algorithm design, implementation, and integration with other modules. In the following, attention will be directed at implementation testing. Implementation testing is not restricted to execution testing. An implementation can also be tested using correctness proofs, code tracing, and peer reviews, as described below. 
•	Debugging is a cyclic activity involving execution testing and code correction. The testing that is done during debugging has a different aim than final module testing. Final module testing aims to demonstrate correctness, whereas testing during debugging is primarily aimed at locating errors. This difference has a significant effect on the choice of testing strategies.

AUTHOR:Shabina.S
YEAR: 2014
DESCRIPTION:
The underground mines all over the world are adversely affected by various hazards including gaseous explosions, landslides, fire hazards, etc. This leads to the significance of safety for the mine workers. A better communication technology has to be employed for an intelligent sensing and warning system. For this, RF technology is chosen for the communication inside the mines. The wireless sensor network is provided for the sensing of adverse working environment conditions. Combining both these technologies, a new smart helmet module is developed. The wireless sensor network consisting of various sensors senses mine environment parameters like temperature, pressure, humidity, gases like methane, carbon monoxide, etc. The measured parameters are processed and are used for an early intelligence warning system with the help of programmed alarm sounds, if there is any serious deviation from the normal parameter value range. The RF technology is also used as locating system, which helps in locating the mine-workers. This RF based wireless sensor network is reliable with easyinstallation and fast sensing and locating system. The design provides three modules, namely helmet module, localizer module, and control room module. The helmet module comprises of various sensors, microcontroller, antennas, encoders, decoders, etc. The helmet module acts as an intelligent, low power node in the wireless sensor network. The control room module contains antennas, PC, decoder, etc. The sensors are used to measure the variations in the temperature, humidity, pressure, fire and take decisions for required actions based on the measured data to ensure the safety of the underground mine workers. The RF technology also ensures the localization of the mine workers for their safety in a dangerous working platform. Thus the proposed system ensures safety and a reliable wireless communication inside the underground mines.

TITLE:Smart Helmets for Safety in Mining Industry
AUTHOR:RohithRevindran, HansiniVijayaraghavan, Mei-Yuan Huang
YEAR :2011
DESCRIPTION:
The mining industry is pivotal to the world’s economy. However, it is not one of the safest industries to work in. The life of miners is always at stake. This project attempts to help the miners in distress so that they receive immediate help. The helmet used by the miner can be improved by adding a wireless sensor mote and necessary sensors, which will help in monitoring the health condition of the miner. In doing so, a network of wireless sensors can be formed. This wireless sensor network (WSN) can be used to monitor the well-being of all the miners who are at work. The routing protocol developed for this project is based on Distance vector routing (DVR) and finds the best path based on shortest hop. The protocol is also robust to deal with failures. It does not require synchronization of the nodes. The protocol is pro-active to minimize delays. Whenever the load felt on the force sensor on the helmet is more than a threshold value, the mote in the helmet attempts to send a distress message to its Room Manager through the saved route. When a miner sends a distress message via its Room Manager, officials from Center can send in a medical team. The miners in the neighboring rooms are also informed so that they can help voluntarily. At times, the mote may not have a route to its Room Manager. In such cases a failure recovery procedure is carried out. The functioning of the project was successfully tested.

	IR SENSOR

An infrared sensor is an electronic device, that emits in order to sense some aspects of the surroundings. An IR sensor can measure the heat of an object as well as detects the motion. These types of sensors measures only infrared radiation, rather than emitting it that is called as a passive IR sensor. Usually in the infrared spectrum, all the objects radiate some form of thermal radiations. These types of radiations are  invisible to our eyes, that can be detected by an infrared sensor.The emitter is simply an IR LED (Light Emitting Diode) and the detector is simply an IR photodiode which is sensitive to IR light of the same wavelength as that emitted by the IR LED. When IR light falls on the photodiode, The resistances and these output voltages, change in proportion to the magnitude of the IR light received.

DC MOTOR

DESCRIPTION

 	A DC motor is any of a class of rotary electrical machines that converts direct current electrical energy into mechanical energy. The most common types rely on the forces produced by magnetic fields. Nearly all types of DC motors have some internal mechanism, either electromechanical or electronic, to periodically change the direction of current flow in part of the motor.
DC motors were the first type widely used, since they could be powered from existing direct-current lighting power distribution systems. A DC motor's speed can be controlled over a wide range, using either a variable supply voltage or by changing the strength of current in its field windings. Small DC motors are used in tools, toys, and appliances. The universal motor can operate on direct current but is a lightweight motor used for portable power tools and appliances. Larger DC motors are used in propulsion of electric vehicles, elevator and hoists, or in drives for steel rolling mills. The advent of power electronics has made replacement of DC motors with AC motors possible in many applications.
The relationship between torque vs speed and current is linear as shown left; as the load on a motor increases, Speed will decrease. The graph pictured here represents the characteristics of a typical motor. As long as the motor is used in the area of high efficiency (as represented by the shaded area) long life and good performance can be expected.
 


DC MOTOR (5000RPM 6V)

	If voltage in continuous applied to a motor in a locked rotor condition, the motor will heat up and fail in a relatively short time. Therefore it is important that there is some form of protection against high temperature rises. A motor's basic rating point is slightly lower than its maximum efficiency point.

A DC motor converts direct current electrical power into mechanical power. DC or direct current motor works on the principal, when a current carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque and has a tendency to move. This is known as motoring action.
	 

DC MOTOR INTERFACE WITH CONTROLLER

	When magnetic field and electric field interact they produce a mechanical force. Thus, a DC motor can be used at a voltage lower than the rated voltage. But, below 1000 rpm, the speed becomes unstable, and the motor will not run smoothly. However, using the motor outside this range will result in high temperature rises and deterioration of motor parts.

•	Supply voltage: 5VDC
•	Very reliable and low cost
•	Speed: 1000rpm
•	The field can be permanent magnet

APPLICATIONS  
•	Electric traction.
•	Vacuum cleaner.
•	Small DC motors are used in tools, toys, and appliances.

GPS MODULE

DESCRIPTION

	The Global Positioning System (GPS), originally Navstar GPS, is a space-based radio navigation system owned by the United States government and operated by the United States Air Force. It is a global navigation satellite system that provides geo location and time information to a GPS receiver anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites. 
The GPS system does not require the user to transmit any data, and it operates independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the GPS positioning information. The GPS system provides critical positioning capabilities to military, civil, and commercial users around the world. The United States government created the system, maintains it, and makes it freely accessible to anyone with a GPS receiver.
 
GPS MODULE
The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a global navigation satellite system that provides location and time information in all weather conditions. The GPS operates independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the GPS positioning information. GPS satellites transmit signal information to earth. This signal information is received by the GPS receiver in order to measure the user’s correct position.
	 
GPS MODULE INTERFACE WITH ARDUINO

             The GPS concept is based on time and the known position of specialized satellites. GPS satellites continuously transmit their current time and position. A GPS receiver monitors multiple satellites and solves equations to determine the precise position of the receiver and its deviation from true time. At a minimum, four satellites must be in view of the receiver for it to compute four unknown quantities.
            Each GPS satellite continually broadcasts a signal (carrier wave with modulation) that includes a pseudorandom code (sequence of ones and zeros) that is known to the receiver and a message that includes the time of transmission (TOT) of the code epoch and the satellite position at that time.

ALCOHOL SENSOR (MQ3)

DESCRIPTION
This alcohol sensor is suitable for detecting alcohol concentration on your breath, just like your common breathalyzer. It has a high sensitivity and fast response time. Sensor provides an analog resistive output based on alcohol concentration.
In current technology scenario, monitoring of gases produced is very important. From home appliances such as air conditioners to electric chimneys and safety systems at industries monitoring of gases is very crucial. Gas sensors spontaneously react to the gas present, thus keeping the system updated about any alterations that occur in the concentration of molecules at gaseous state. The gas sensor module consists of a steel exoskeleton under which a sensing element is housed.
 
ALCOHOL SENSOR (MQ3)
This sensing element is subjected to current through connecting leads. This current is known as heating current through it, the gases coming close to the sensing element get ionized and are absorbed by the sensing element.

POWER SUPPLY UNIT

DESCRIPTION
A power supply unit (or PSU) converts mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a computer. Modern personal computers universally use switched-mode power supplies. Some power supplies have a manual switch for selecting input voltage, while others automatically adapt to the mains voltage.
 A power supply is used to reduce the mains electricity at 240 volts AC down to some thing more useable, say 12 volts DC. There are two types of power supply, linear and switch mode. A linear power supply uses a transformer to reduce the voltage. The AC signal is rectified and regulated to produce a high DC voltage.
An AC adapter, AC/DC adapter, or AC/DC converteris a type of external power supply, often enclosed in a case similar to an AC plug. Adapters for battery-powered equipment may be described as chargers or rechargers (see also battery charger). AC adapters are used with electrical devices that require power but do not contain internal components to derive the required voltage and power from main power. The internal circuitry of an external power supply is very similar to the design that would be used for a built-in or internal supply.
 
ADAPTER (12V 1AMP)
An adapter is a device that converts attributes of one electrical device or system to those of an otherwise incompatible device or system. Some modify power or signal attributes, while others merely adapt the physical form of one electrical connector to another. In a computer, an adapter is often built into a card that can be inserted into a slot on the computer's motherboard. The card adapts information that is exchanged between the computer's microprocessor and the devices that the card supports.
 
CIRCUIT DIAGRAM 
An electric power adapter may enable connection of a power plug, sometimes called, used in one region to a AC power socket used in another, by offering connections for the disparate contact arrangements, while not changing the voltage. An AC adapter, also called a "recharger", is a small power supply that changes household electric current from distribution voltage) to low voltage DC suitable for consumer electronics. 
Some modify power or signal attributes, while others merely adapt the physical form of one electrical connector to another. For computers and related items, one kind of serial port adapter enables connections between 25-contact and nine-contact connectors, but does not affect electrical power- and signalling-related attributes

GPS MODULE
DESCRIPTION
The Global Positioning System (GPS), originally Navstar GPS, is a space-based radio navigation system owned by the United States government and operated by the United States Air Force. It is a global navigation satellite system that provides geo location and time information to a GPS receiver anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites. 
The GPS system does not require the user to transmit any data, and it operates independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the GPS positioning information. The GPS system provides critical positioning capabilities to military, civil, and commercial users around the world. The United States government created the system, maintains it, and makes it freely accessible to anyone with a GPS receiver.
 
GPS MODULE
The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a global navigation satellite system that provides location and time information in all weather conditions. The GPS operates independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the GPS positioning information. GPS satellites transmit signal information to earth. This signal information is received by the GPS receiver in order to measure the user’s correct position.
	 
GPS MODULE INTERFACE WITH ARDUINO

The GPS concept is based on time and the known position of specialized satellites. GPS satellites continuously transmit their current time and position. A GPS receiver monitors multiple satellites and solves equations to determine the precise position of the receiver and its deviation from true time. At a minimum, four satellites must be in view of the receiver for it to compute four unknown quantities.
Each GPS satellite continually broadcasts a signal (carrier wave with modulation) that includes a pseudorandom code (sequence of ones and zeros) that is known to the receiver and a message that includes the time of transmission (TOT) of the code epoch and the satellite position at that time.
FEATURES 
•	Supply voltage: 12v DC
•	Interface: UART RS232
•	Optional T-TL uart also available
•	Precision: 5 meters
•	Automatic antenna switching function

 APPLICATIONS  
•	GPS trackers
•	Automated vehicle
•	Robotics
•	Fleet tracking



SOFTWARE DESCRIPTION
ARDUINO IDE:
The Arduino Integrated Development Environment - or Arduino Software (IDE) - contains a text editor for writing code, a message area, a text console, a toolbar with buttons for common functions and a series of menus. It connects to the Arduino and Genuino hardware to upload programs and communicate with them.
Programs written using Arduino Software (IDE) are called sketches. These sketches are written in the text editor and are saved with the file extension .ino. The editor has features for cutting/pasting and for searching/replacing text. The message area gives feedback while saving and exporting and also displays errors. The console displays text output by the Arduino Software (IDE), including complete error messages and other information. The bottom righthand corner of the window displays the configured board and serial port. The toolbar buttons allow you to verify and upload programs, create, open, and save sketches, and open the serial monitor.
Before uploading your sketch, you need to select the correct items from the Tools>Board and Tools >Port menus. The boards are described below. On the Mac, the serial port is probably something like /dev/tty.usbmodem241 (for an Uno or Mega2560 or Leonardo) or /dev/tty.usbserial-1B1 (for a Duemilanove or earlier USB board), or /dev/tty.USA19QW1b1P1.1 (for a serial board connected with a Keyspan USB-to-Serial adapter). On Windows, it's probably COM1 or COM2 (for a serial board) or COM4, COM5, COM7, or higher (for a USB board) - to find out, you look for USB serial device in the ports section of the Windows Device Manager. On Linux, it should be /dev/ttyACMx , /dev/ttyUSBx or similar. Once you've selected the correct serial port and board, press the upload button in the toolbar or select the Upload item from the Sketch menu. Current Arduino boards will reset automatically and begin the upload. With older boards (pre-Diecimila) that lack auto-reset, you'll need to press the reset button on the board just before starting the upload. On most boards, you'll see the RX and TX LEDs blink as the sketch is uploaded. The Arduino Software (IDE) will display a message when the upload is complete, or show an error.
When you upload a sketch, you're using the Arduino bootloader, a small program that has been loaded on to the microcontroller on your board. It allows you to upload code without using any additional hardware. The bootloader is active for a few seconds when the board resets; then it starts whichever sketch was most recently uploaded to the microcontroller. The bootloader will blink the on-board (pin 13) LED when it starts (i.e. when the board resets).

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:
Embedded C is a set of language extensions for the C programming language by the C Standards Committee to address commonality issues that exist between Cextensions for different embedded systems.
Embedded C is a set of language extensions for the C programming language by the C Standards Committee to address commonality issues that exist between C extensions for different embedded systems. Historically, embedded C programming requires nonstandard extensions to the C language in order to support exotic features such as fixed-point arithmetic, multiple distinct memory banks, and basic I/O operations
An embedded system is a computer system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today. Ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors are manufactured as components of embedded systems. 
Examples of properties of typical embedded computers when compared with general-purpose counterparts are low power consumption, small size, rugged operating ranges, and low per-unit cost. This comes at the price of limited processing resources, which make them significantly more difficult to program and to interact with. However, by building intelligence mechanisms on top of the hardware, taking advantage of possible existing sensors and the existence of a network of embedded units, one can both optimally manage available resources at the unit and network levels as well as provide augmented functions, well beyond those available. For example, intelligent techniques can be designed to manage power consumption of embedded systems. 
Modern embedded systems are often based on microcontrollers (i.e. CPU's with integrated memory or peripheral interfaces), but ordinary microprocessors (using external chips for memory and peripheral interface circuits) are also common, especially in more-complex systems. In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand. A common standard class of dedicated processors is the digital signal processor (DSP).
Since the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, design engineers can optimize it to reduce the size and cost of the product and increase the reliability and performance. Some embedded systems are mass-produced, benefiting from economies of scale.
Embedded systems range from portable devices such as digital watches and MP3 players, to large stationary installations like traffic lights, factory controllers, and largely complex systems like hybrid vehicles, MRI, and avionics. Complexity varies from low, with a single microcontroller chip, to very high with multiple units, peripherals and networks mounted inside a large chassis or enclosure.


INTERNET OF THINGS (IoT):
 The Internet of things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects “things” that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the Internet.
Things have evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, real-time analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and embedded systems. Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), and others all contribute to enabling the Internet of things. In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the "smart home", including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers. IoT can also be used in healthcare systems.
The IoT is the strategy for gadgets that encase hardware, and network, which enables these devices to fix, act together and switch information. IoT incorporates broadening Internet beneficial than standard gadgets, for example, work areas to any decision of generally  non web get to material gadgets and on a day by day source objects. Inserted through innovation, these gadgets can banter and coordinate over the Internet, and they can be a little checked and restricted.
